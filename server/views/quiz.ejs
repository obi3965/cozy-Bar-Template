                          <p>Are you looking for a way to put a little bit of time into an otherwise slightly gray everyday
                            evening? Then take your smartest friends under your arm and visit the Flintstone Pub. Here you do
                            not have to wait for the weekend to get a cozy and fun evening in the city. On the first and last
                            Tuesday of each month, Flintstone Pub opens its doors to the pub quiz. Here is the guarantee of
                            sharp competition, good atmosphere and high mood behind the bar. We dare to call our quiz evening
                            the best and most fun in Aarhus, and even though it is fun enough just to be there, there is of
                            course a fantastic prize for the winners. If you and your team manage to outperform all the
                            others, you get nothing less than a whole bottle of splash with accessories. And just calm down -
                            it can of course also be saved for other evenings if the work or study call early Wednesday
                            morning.</p>
